## 🚨 Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, users often reuse weak passwords or rely on predictable combinations that are easy to guess or hack.  
Manual password creation can be both **time-consuming** and **insecure**, leading to **data breaches** and **account compromises**.

## 💡 Solution Approach
The Smart Password Generator solves this by:
- Taking user details (name, email, mobile number, etc.) as input.  
- Randomly selecting:
  - **2 characters** from the first name  
  - **2 characters** from the last name  
  - **6 random characters** from the remaining data pool  
- Generating a **10-character secure password**.  
- Displaying **real-time password strength** using a color-coded progress bar.  
- Providing **AI-like feedback messages** to guide the user.  
- Offering **interactive features** like show/hide password, copy to clipboard, and reset options.
